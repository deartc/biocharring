Biochar Star

Biochar Star is a webpage template for a business.  The webpage submitted in class was designed specifically to satsify specific requiremnts for the class.  I will  transition it to a business webpage in the future that sells biochar and related items.   

CSS 

The colors chosen for website were primarily charcoal, black, and gray which reflects colors of biochar.  Green was also used to reflect nature.  I kept the webite design simple because primarily users will be envrionmentally conscious people who prefer simplicity. I adjusted in css for mobile and desktop usage which meets the mobile first requirement. I used responsive design for the navigation bar which meets the responsive design requirement.  The navigation bar includes text that changes color when hovered over which was also an optional requirement. I also used responsive design for the contact page to include  Biochar Star's email and address. I designed it specifically without footers.  I wanted to meet the requirment of responsive design change of size of container objects using media queries.     



Custom javaScript functions
 I created user forms.  To meet requriements I wanted to validate email.  wanted to use a more advanced function than javacript to  check email validation so that it would be returned with either the positive validation message in green or not validated in red.  I also used javasript to aid in responsive design.

  

Accessibility:  I followed best practices to ensure that the website was accessible for those users with slower internet connections. The html, css , and javascript was loaded in that order in order to allow for faster accesss.   I  personally designed logo in paint so that it loads quickly and labeled it to meet accessibility rules.
